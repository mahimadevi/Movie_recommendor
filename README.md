# Movie Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering

#  What the project does
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using content-based filtering. It suggests movies to users based on the similarities between their selected movie and other movies in the dataset. The system considers various features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew to provide personalized recommendations.

# Why the project is useful
The Movie Recommender System is beneficial for users who enjoy personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences. It helps users discover new movies that are likely to match their interests, creating a more engaging and enjoyable movie-watching experience.
